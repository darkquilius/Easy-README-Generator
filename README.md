#### Title: 
    Easy-README-Generator
#### Description:
    The difference between a great project and an ok project often lies in the README. The Markdown is often the
    first thing people are drawn toward. But a good README takes time and effort away from the developer. With 
    this app, answer a few questions using the inquirer npm and a auto-generated markdown is returned. Stop 
    taking time writing markdowns and spend more time writing code!
